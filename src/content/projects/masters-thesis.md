## Thesis Abstract

In this thesis we analysed the genome of Streptomyces cyangenus S136 in context of the specialized metabolism potential. In particular we annotated the biosynthetic gene clusters using different software, such as deepBGC, antismash and gecco. Made two programs: rRNADif and BGCViz, with Python, R and bash scripts.
