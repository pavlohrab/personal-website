rRNADif analyzes intragenomic 16S rRNA variability by calculating maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees and using branch length statistics. The tool compares variation between ribosomal RNA sequences within genomes against a precomputed reference database spanning over 21,000 fully sequenced bacterial genomes. It supports custom database creation and provides automated 16S rRNA sequence extraction and analysis.
