## Project Overview

Bacteria from the phylum Acidobacteriota are widely distributed across diverse environments, yet only a few representatives have been isolated and described, with the majority retrieved from soil. Although recent studies suggest substantial biosynthetic potential in Acidobacteriota across soil and marine environments, no comprehensive cross-biome analysis has yet been conducted yet. To address this gap, we analyzed 19,720 metagenome-assembled genomes from Acidobacteriota along with their environmental metadata to provides a systematic overview of the biosynthetic potential of Acidobacteriota.

## Key Findings

We collected 19720 MAGs from public databases and dereplicated them at a species level. The comprehensive BGC annotation of the data is ongoing
