## Project Overview

Marine sponges and corals host abundant Acidobacteriota, yet it is unclear whether adaptation to these dynamic microhabitats proceeds via convergent genomic adaptations or lineage-specific routes. We collected and analyzed 488 marine Acidobacteriota genomes spanning 16 families to distinguish ecological adaptation from the shared ancestry.
