BGCViz enables researchers to visualize overlaps between biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) annotations from six different detection methods: Antismash, PRISM, SEMPI, DeepBGC, RRE-Finder, and ARTS. The tool identifies regions detected by multiple tools or novel regions found by single methods through interactive circular visualizations using BioCircos. Built with R and Shiny framework, it supports multiple file formats and is available as a web application or for local deployment.
